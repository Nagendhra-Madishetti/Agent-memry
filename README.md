# Cogniflow

**Temporal, self-falsifying belief substrate for agentic RAG.** The combination of a
bi-temporal knowledge graph (à la Graphiti) with an agentic retrieval loop (à la
LlamaIndex), welded by a closed feedback loop: retrieve → check validity → falsify
superseded beliefs → persist the verdict → reshape the next retrieval.

This is **ChronoRAG** (temporal) × **PALIMPSEST** (self-falsifying) as a library.

> **Status: Phase 2 (the loop closes - write-back).**
> The agent's own action reshapes the memory it reads. Via a `record_observation`
> tool, the agent enqueues a write that ingests asynchronously and automatically
> falsifies what it contradicts; a later point-in-time read reflects the supersession.
> Proven through the agent: record "Acme moved to Seattle, 2024", drain the queue, then
> `as_of=2023` -> Denver and `as_of=2025` -> Seattle, with the Denver edge
> auto-invalidated by ingestion (falsification is free). The production component is the
> `WriteBackQueue` (`cogniflow/writeback.py`): per-`group_id` serial, concurrent across
> groups, non-blocking enqueue, bounded backpressure (reject-with-signal), retry with
> dead-letter, deterministic `drain()`, and a `last_ingested_at` freshness surface.
> Deferred: pluggable policies (Phase 3), replay/audit API (Phase 4), inline
> `verify_fact` (Phase 5), advanced rerank (Phase 5).

## Design rule

The **core is dependency-free**. `cogniflow.core` imports nothing but the standard
library. Heavy dependencies (`graphiti-core`, `llama-index-core`, `falkordb`) are pulled
in only by *backends* and *bridges*, and only when their optional extras are installed.
This is what keeps the contracts stable and the architecture pluggable.

### The three substrate operations
- **write(episode)** → `WriteReceipt` — ingest a source episode into beliefs.
- **read(query)** → `RetrievalResult` — retrieve beliefs valid as-of a point in time.
- **falsify(target, against=…)** → `FalsificationVerdict` — decide if a belief is superseded.

### The four policy interfaces (the seams from the design analysis)
| Policy | Seam | Question it answers |
|---|---|---|
| `RetrievalPolicy` | read | how to resolve as-of and rank candidates |
| `ValidityPolicy` | invalidate | is this belief valid at time *t*? |
| `FalsificationPolicy` | falsify | is this belief superseded, and by what? |
| `WritebackPolicy` | write-back | should a retrieval outcome become a new belief? |

## Install (dev)

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Prove the skeleton

```bash
ruff check .
pytest
```

Phase-0 proof: the contracts are stable (field-surface is frozen by tests), a no-op
backend passes the conformance stub, and CI is green across Python 3.10–3.12.
