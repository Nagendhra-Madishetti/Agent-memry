# Cogniflow

**Temporal, self-falsifying belief substrate for agentic RAG.** The combination of a
bi-temporal knowledge graph (à la Graphiti) with an agentic retrieval loop (à la
LlamaIndex), welded by a closed feedback loop: retrieve → check validity → falsify
superseded beliefs → persist the verdict → reshape the next retrieval.

This is **ChronoRAG** (temporal) × **PALIMPSEST** (self-falsifying) as a library.

> **Status: Phase 4 (the audit / replay layer - the differentiator as infrastructure).**
> The dual-axis bi-temporal model is now a real, headless audit surface (`AuditLedger`,
> an opt-in read-only capability separate from the substrate): event-time ("what was true
> in the world at T"), system-time replay ("what did the system believe at S"), the
> bitemporal point query ("believed at S about world-time T"), and a provenance trace.
> The centerpiece is the **un-knowing** invariant: a replay to S un-knows any invalidation
> the system learned after S, so a fact superseded later reads as live-and-un-superseded
> from S's vantage - never leaking knowledge backward in time. Replay is **not search**:
> it pushes the temporal predicate straight into Cypher (resolving the long-tracked
> FalkorDriver `search_filter` no-op) and never over-fetches history. Replay is fully
> deterministic (no LLM) and is the most heavily invariant-tested surface in the project.
> Deferred: LLM-driven `verify_fact` (Phase 5), advanced rerank + replay caching (Phase 5),
> replay UI (separate optional package), multi-backend (Phase 6).

## Design rule

The **core is dependency-free**. `cogniflow.core` imports nothing but the standard
library. Heavy dependencies (`graphiti-core`, `llama-index-core`, `falkordb`) are pulled
in only by *backends* and *bridges*, and only when their optional extras are installed.
This is what keeps the contracts stable and the architecture pluggable.

### The three substrate operations
- **write(episode)** → `WriteReceipt` — ingest a source episode into beliefs.
- **read(query)** → `RetrievalResult` — retrieve beliefs valid as-of a point in time.
- **falsify(target, against=…)** → `FalsificationVerdict` — decide if a belief is superseded.

### The four policy interfaces (the seams from the design analysis)
| Policy | Seam | Question it answers |
|---|---|---|
| `RetrievalPolicy` | read | how to resolve as-of and rank candidates |
| `ValidityPolicy` | invalidate | is this belief valid at time *t*? |
| `FalsificationPolicy` | falsify | is this belief superseded, and by what? |
| `WritebackPolicy` | write-back | should a retrieval outcome become a new belief? |

## Install (dev)

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Prove the skeleton

```bash
ruff check .
pytest
```

Phase-0 proof: the contracts are stable (field-surface is frozen by tests), a no-op
backend passes the conformance stub, and CI is green across Python 3.10–3.12.
